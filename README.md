Pay slips are provided to the employees to record their monthly pay and allowances. It is a document that provides the employees with details of their incomes and deductions as it would differ from employee to employee. Manual salary slips are outdated, now as most of them work in technology using companies and the pdf file of a salary slip is received on salary day. Issuing manual salary slip and HRMS system might be time-consuming and might consume a lot of paper. We propose an online human resource and payroll management system project which helps in generating salary of the employees every month without worries. This HR payroll software will help in distribution of pay slips to employees and also helps to manage employee information efficiently. This payroll system has one HR module.
